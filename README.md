This project contains the esoco-lib library that contains generic, application-independent code that can be of use for almost all development projects. It defines some fundamental data structures and interfaces and provides utility functions for several areas like I/O, reflection, string handling and more. It depends on the [ObjectRelations project](https://esoco.github.io/objectrelations/). 

For more information please see the [Javadoc](http://esoco.github.io/esoco-lib/javadoc/).
