# The esoco-lib project

[![](https://github.com/esoco/esoco-lib/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/esoco/esoco-lib/actions)

This project contains the esoco-lib library that contains generic,
application-independent code that can be of use for almost all development
projects. It defines some fundamental data structures and interfaces and
provides utility functions for several areas like I/O, reflection, string
handling and more. It depends on
the [ObjectRelations project](https://esoco.github.io/objectrelations/).

For more information please see
the [Javadoc](http://esoco.github.io/esoco-lib/javadoc/).
