/********************************************************************
 * A pure Java implementation of cooperative concurrency, also known as
 * coroutines. Coroutines implement lightweight multiprocessing, where all
 * running coroutines share the available execution threads, yielding on each
 * processing steps to give other coroutines the chance to execute. Furthermore
 * coroutines can suspend their execution when waiting for other coroutines or
 * external resources (e.g. data to be sent or received), giving other code the
 * chance to use the available threads.
 *
 * <p>To achieve this functionality, the implementation makes use of modern Java
 * features that are available since Java 8. The execution of coroutine steps is
 * done by means of {@link CompletableFuture} which in turn runs the code by
 * default in the {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool() common thread pool} defined
 * in the {@link ForkJoinPool} class. But the actual {@link Executor} used for
 * running coroutines can be changed as needed.</p>
 *
 * <p>To provide a fluent and readable declaration the API makes extensive use
 * of the new functional programming features of Java and the (recommended) use
 * of static imports. By using these, especially with lambda expressions and
 * method references a concise and easily understandable declaration of
 * coroutines is possible.</p>
 *
 * <p>Basically a coroutine itself is only a function that receives an input
 * value, processes it, and return an output value as the result of the
 * execution. This is similar to the {@link Function} interface introduced with
 * Java 8. If invoked with the method {@link #runBlocking(Object)} it will
 * behave exactly like a simple function, blocking the current thread until the
 * processing has finished and the result value has been produced. But if
 * invoked with {@link #runAsync(Object)} the coroutine will be executed
 * parallel to the current thread, interrupting it's execution shortly between
 * processing steps or even pausing until some data is available.</p>
 *
 * <p>Besides this class there are a few other classes that play a role in the
 * execution of coroutines:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link CoroutineContext}: Each coroutine runs in a certain context
 *     which can either be provided explicitly to {@link
 *     #runAsync(CoroutineContext, Object)} or is created automatically
 *     otherwise. If coroutines need to communicate during their execution they
 *     need to run in the same context.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Continuation}: Every execution of a coroutine is associated with
 *     a continuation object that contains the current state and is local to
 *     that execution and not shared with other running instances. It implements
 *     the {@link Future} interface (and some additional methods) so that it can
 *     be used to query and synchronize with the current execution state. The
 *     steps of a coroutine can use the continuation to share state between them
 *     which or deliver complex results which otherwise could be carried through
 *     the input and output values easily.</li>
 *   <li>{@link CoroutineStep}: This inner class is the base for all steps that
 *     can be executed in a coroutine. Like the coroutine itself it basically is
 *     a function that receives and input value (and a {@link Continuation}) and
 *     produces a result. There are additional methods to support the
 *     asynchronous execution and specialized steps use these to implement
 *     features like suspension in these. Several standard steps are defined in
 *     the 'step' sub-package but the base class can also be extended to create
 *     new kinds of coroutine steps.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Channel}: The previous classes are always involved when building
 *     and executing coroutines. Channels are an optional feature that allows
 *     multiple coroutines to communicate. When waiting to send or receive data
 *     through a channel coroutines will automatically suspend execution and
 *     continue to run as soon as the communication becomes possible. They are
 *     managed by the {@link CoroutineContext} a coroutine runs in. Therefore
 *     all coroutines that need to communicate through a channel need to run in
 *     the same context.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Suspension}: a suspension also only occurs in advanced
 *     coroutines. If a coroutine needs to wait for some external condition
 *     (like a {@link Channel} operation) it creates a suspension that contains
 *     the current state of the coroutine. The waiting code can then use that
 *     suspension to resume the execution when the condition is fulfilled.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A coroutine can either be created by invoking the {@link
 * #Coroutine(CoroutineStep) constructor} with the first {@link CoroutineStep}
 * to execute or by invoking the factory method {@link #first(CoroutineStep)}.
 * The latter allows to declare a coroutine in a fluent way with better
 * readability. There is a slight limitation caused by the generic type system
 * of Java: if the result of {@link #first(CoroutineStep) first()} is assigned
 * to a variable with a specific input type it may be necessary to declare the
 * input type explicitly in a lambda expression. For example, the following
 * example (using a static import of {@link #first(CoroutineStep) first()}) may
 * cause a compiler error:</p>
 * <code>Coroutine&lt;String, String&gt; toUpper = first(s ->
 * s.toUpperCase());</code>
 *
 * <p>To make the code compile, the type of the lambda argument needs to be
 * declared explicitly:</p>
 * <code>Coroutine&lt;String, String&gt; toUpper = first((String s) ->
 * s.toUpperCase());</code>
 *
 * <p>After a coroutine has been created it can be extended with additional
 * steps by invoking {@link #then(CoroutineStep)}. This method takes the next
 * step to be executed and <b>returns a new coroutine instance</b>. This means
 * that coroutines are <b>effectively immutable</b>, i.e. they cannot be
 * modified after they have been created. Only new coroutines can be created
 * from them. This allows to build coroutine templates that can be extended by
 * adding additional processing steps without changing them. The {@link
 * #then(CoroutineStep) then()} methods implement a builder pattern. Together
 * with the {@link #first(CoroutineStep) first()} method and the builder methods
 * of the step implementations this forms a set of fluent API methods to create
 * coroutines.</p>
 *
 * <p>The immutability of coroutines only covers the "explicit" internal state
 * but not the relations. Coroutine also extends {@link RelatedObject} and
 * therefore allows to set arbitrary relations on it. These could be used to
 * configure step behavior or pre-set data, for example. To also make the
 * relations of an instance immutable (e.g. to "seal" a template) just set the
 * flag relation {@link MetaTypes#IMMUTABLE IMMUTABLE} on it which will prevent
 * the further modification of relations. This will then also effect all running
 * instances of the coroutine (see below).</p>
 *
 * <p>When a coroutine is executed a copy of it is created and then associated
 * with a new {@link Continuation} instance. That prevents running code to
 * modify the state of the coroutine it has been started from but on the other
 * hand gives it access to any relations defined in the coroutine. The actual
 * runtime state is stored in the continuation object and may be modified freely
 * by the coroutine code. It is recommended that coroutine steps use the
 * continuation if the need to store and share data beside the standard input
 * and output parameters. The handling of coroutines and their copying may be
 * modified in later versions of the framework.</p>
 *
 * <p>Accessing state in the continuation can be done without further
 * synchronization because the steps in a coroutine are executed sequentially
 * and never concurrently (unless stated otherwise in some special step
 * implementations maybe). But if steps access variables outside the
 * continuation they must apply the same caution like other multi-threaded code
 * in Java because access to such resource may (and will probably) need
 * synchronization to avoid concurrency issues (which are notoriously difficult
 * to debug). This included the {@link CoroutineContext} which can be shared by
 * multiple running coroutines (or coroutine instances). There are no
 * synchronization mechanisms in the default context implementation. If a step
 * implementation wants to modify data (e.g. relations) in the context it must
 * perform the necessary synchronization itself.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Attention:</b> Should synchronization be necessary it should be applied
 * with caution. Coroutines implement <b>cooperative multi-tasking</b>. That
 * means that the steps are executed in a thread pool which typically assumes
 * that the code running in the pool only occupies a thread as long as needed
 * for processing. Blocking such a thread in some way (like waiting for a lock,
 * accessing a synchronized resource, or just sleeping) counteracts the purpose
 * of the thread pool in particular and of cooperative multi-tasking in general.
 * Therefore it is strongly recommended to not perform "classical"
 * synchronizations from coroutine steps. Instead it should be checked whether
 * it is possible to implement this in a cooperative way by suspending the
 * coroutine execution while waiting for a resource. That waiting could be
 * performed in a separate thread (outside of the coroutine thread pool) and
 * resume the coroutine when the resource becomes available.</p>
